        <h2>Custom and dynamic admin interface</h2>
        <p>
          You run agents on your infrastructure. They connect via secure TCP to the hosted service.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are able to present lists views, detail views, and perform actions through a nice clean web UI.
        </p>
        <p>Why would I need it?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a non-tech person needs to perform tasks that are usually only accessible via command line</li>
          <li>a tech person wants to access data and perform tasks in a safe, easy, audited way</li>
          <li>you want all your data and admin tasks available from one place</li>
          <li>you can't justify building a UI</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example use cases:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>provide buttons to clear a cache inside your app</li>
          <li>present a simple way to browse/edit your database</li>
          <li>embed as a lib inside your app, and show currently connected users</li>
          <li>store useful SQL/db queries so anyone can run them</li>
          <li>present a simple UI for an API</li>
          <li>run a script on a remote box</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          Server accepts websocket connections from browser, and TCP connections
          from agent runner. Both secured with TLS.
        </p>
        <p>I run server, you run agent runner.</p>

        <h2>Roadmap / Status</h2>
        <p>
          It's very new, I just made it. It's only a proof-of-concept for now.
          I didn't even give it a name or buy a domain for it.
        </p>
        <p>Things it might do one day:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>present information other than lists and details - graphs, images, etc</li>
          <li>create custom panels with your favourite views</li>
          <li>auto-refresh content</li>
          <li>provide a REST API and/or CLI tool</li>
          <li>connect with hosted services via oAuth - no need to run your own agents</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I want to see if anybody wants it first.
